# üñºÔ∏è Pixel Manipulator

A simple GUI-based tool built with Python that allows users to apply basic image effects and a reversible "encryption" using pixel transformations. Great for learning OpenCV and GUI development with Tkinter.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìÇ Load any image from your system
- üåë Convert image to **Grayscale**
- üí® Apply **Gaussian Blur** effect
- üîÑ **Encrypt** image by flipping pixels (visually distorts image)
- ‚è™ **Decrypt** by flipping again (restores original)
- üíæ Save the processed image using a file dialog
- üß† Educational GUI made with Tkinter

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The "encryption" here is purely visual and reversible ‚Äî not secure or cryptographic. It's designed for learning purposes only.

## üß† How It Works

- **Grayscale:** Converts the image to black and white using OpenCV.
- **Blur:** Applies a softening Gaussian blur filter.
- **Encrypt (Flip):** Flips image both vertically and horizontally.
- **Decrypt:** Applies the same flip operation again to reverse it.
